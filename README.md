##  ðŸ§© Creating a Custom Annotation

###  What I Did:
I defined a custom annotation to represent enhancement requests in a codebase.
It includes the following fields:

`id`

`synopsis`

`engineer (default: "unassigned")`

`date (default: "unknown")`

###  Why It Matters:
Annotations are a powerful way to embed metadata or documentation directly into the code.

###  What I Learned:

-  How to create and use custom annotations with @Retention and @Target

-  How to set default values for annotation elements

-  Real-world uses: tagging classes with enhancement notes or pending tasks
